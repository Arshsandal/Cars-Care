# Instructions
## Edit `index.html` and `style.css` to re-create the design above.
 * Remember, use semantic HTML to re-create the structure, and style each element using CSS to make a perfect copy of the above image.
 * All the images and icons you need can be found in the img folder, and the font 'Roboto' is already loaded into the project.
 * Only create the desktop design for now.
